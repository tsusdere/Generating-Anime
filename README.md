# Generating-Anime
Use GANs in order to generate anime faces
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain an understaing on how Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) work in order to generate images from noise.
The theme of this project was 'anime' this was chose as many GAN examples inolve generating human faces or attributes and there is not much research or
projects involving 2D characters. It will also add some fun to the project.
## Datasets
The datasets provided are the **Anime Faces** & **selfie2anime** datasets. The first dataset contains 64x64 RGB anime faces with a white background and simple features as opposed to the second dataset. The second dataset **selfie2anime** involves
